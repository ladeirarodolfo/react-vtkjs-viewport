## Install

```bash
# With NPM
npm install --save react-vtkjs-viewport-custom

# With Yarn
yarn add react-vtkjs-viewport-custom
```

## Development

Local development uses `<root>/examples` as a test application. You can import
the VTK Viewport using a WebPack alias like so:

`import VtkViewport from '@vtk-viewport'`

Any updates to the example files or the VtkViewport's source will cause WebPack
to rebuild.

```bash
# Restore Dependencies
yarn install

# Start Local Dev Server
yarn run dev
```
